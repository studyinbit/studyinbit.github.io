## 💬 Questions or Suggestions?

Before I start building, do you have:
1. Any other changes to the content plans?
2. Specific pages you want me to prioritize?
3. Any design preferences I should know about?
4. Access to the actual images in `/public/images/uni/`?

If everything looks good, I'll start building the design system and components! 🎨
