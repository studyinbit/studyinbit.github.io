Okay great!

## 00 overall plan
Lets use Clash Display for the hero section, i kinda like it.

btw i have added the icons for (BIND, PERMIT, PPIT Tiongkok, BIT) (they have a white bg, you can tell me if you want them removed, i can do it easily)
Btw the icons will look wierd against a dark background. Can we rework the theme and colors to be light mode (unless you have ideas on how we can fix it)?

Just in case i forgot to include the link in the docs.md

   - Create component library
   - Build reusable sections

Yes please thank you :D

1. **Content Priorities**: Which pages are most critical to launch first?
It is up to you, do it from most important to least.

2. **Contact Information**: Do you have the actual WhatsApp numbers, emails, and social media handles?

Timothy Pardin - Free constulation (student in bit, we can help discuss requirements, answer questions, and apply)
http://wa.me/6281388577873

3. **Assets**: Do you have access to campus photos in `/public/images/uni/`? What's available?
Yes, for now it is images of capus grounds, dorms, public spaces (canteens), events, etc.
It is placeholder, and I might change it in the future. You can add placeholder labels if needed.

4. **Branding**: Are there specific BIT or BIND brand colors/logos I should use?
We don't really have a brand logo or color, feel free to invent one :D You can also suggest me on how I can make one.

5. **Timeline**: When do you need this launched? (I won't estimate time, but knowing urgency helps prioritize)
I have plenty of time, take your time.

6. **Interactive Features**: Which interactive elements are must-haves vs nice-to-haves?
   - ROI Calculator (what is this? like carrier roi?)
   - Cost Calculator (sure ig)
   - Virtual tour (Sure, we can do it with images, for now just use placeholder images with placeholder labels)
   - Video testimonials (we may have videos, and ppts available for download but not testimonials)
   - Live chat integration (we have whatsapp already, we can skip this)

7. **Data**: Do you have actual statistics for:
   - Number of Indonesian students (atleast 400+)
   - Scholarship success rates
   - Employment rates
   - Salary data
   - Or should I use the numbers from docs.md as placeholders? (yeah lets use it as placeholders for now)

8. **Aesthetic Direction**: Any preferences or concerns about the proposed design direction (dark mode with warm/cool gradients, modern tech-forward aesthetic)?
(the one i had earlier about the icons; also i think its alittle non standard for uni to use dark theme)

9. **Existing Materials**: Do you have existing PPTs, videos, or documents that should be linked/embedded?
(We have ppts for our presentations later on, videos, map pdf, sample jastip pdfs, and bit guides pdf from the last year that we provide here, but they are non-essential)

10. **Target Launch**: Is this for a specific recruitment cycle (e.g., 2026 admissions)?
No need to explicitly specify on the site ig

## 01 homepage
Mmm, i like the "Build the Future." part, the From Beijing to Jakarta one feels abit off for a headline, because there are many others from different cities and different parts of indonesia.

Also I kinda like pill shaped blur overlays/navigation, i think its trending, just make it look nice. altough it doesn't provide much space for our many sub pages, so hmmm, any ideas? `./content-plan/images/nice-navbar-n-hero.png`
`./content-plan/images/nice-navbar-n-expansion.png`


Lets remove the 'career networking' (feels abit a goal oriented)
### Card 2: "Indonesian Community"
- Icon: People/Community
- Text: "BIND support system: group study, cultural events, zero-stress arrival"

### Card 3: "Unbeatable ROI"
- Icon: Chart/Growth
- Text: "500-900 RMB/month dorms. 30-50 RMB/day food. CSC scholarships available."
- Link: "Calculate Costs →"

(please make this page configurable if you are making this)

no testimonials

btw we don't have social media links, only that whatsapp phone number.
The insagram is seperate group/entity from us

"  - 80% of curriculum is hands-on"
This is not true atleast in my experience with cs

"- **Stats**:
  - 200+ industry partnerships
  - 90% of seniors have internship offers before graduation
  - Direct recruitment from top Chinese tech firms"

Hmm yeah maybe for the chinese local students. not so sure for international students, i don't have much info on this.

- Community: Cultural nights, e-sports, mental health support
They do no have mental health support, but qna groups and tours for when we just arrived. and they have a jastip service.

```
## Section 5: ROI Calculator (Interactive)
### Tool
Simple calculator where users input:
- Scholarship type (None, Partial, Full CSC)
- Living style (Budget, Moderate, Comfortable)

**Output:**
- Total 4-year cost
- Comparison with local universities

Oh, lets change it into a cost calculator instead of a ROI calculator.

### Visual
- Clean, modern calculator interface
- Animated results with charts
- "Share results" button
```

## 03 campus life
Oh i have an idea for this, maybe we have images and when there is a cursor hover or a touch we have a gradient blur from the bottom and show text/details (please make this configurable)

"- Quiet environment for concentration"
this is very untrue

### Subheadline
"Superior to cramped central Beijing dorms. Modern, comfortable, affordable."
Lets just make this afforable, good value instead. Too much unmet praise/facts

### Room Types (Side-by-side comparison cards)

We have 3 rooms types
2,3,4 person dorms on the old building
and new 4 people dorms with 2 bedrooms (2 people per bedroom)
just do placeholder stuff for now
we also have washing/drying machine

- Common areas for socializing
basement on the old building, we can attach images ig

### Interactive Element
- 360° virtual tour of dorm rooms
we can skip this

## 04 indonesian community
skip all of the testemonial
and interactive element, and skip join bind

## 06 carrier roi
lets skip this section entirly, because i don't really know much about carrier paths, and am not 100% sure.

## 07 faq
please make this configurable

skip the two whatsapp options
we don't have an email or instagram for "Study in BIT"

Please update the respective plan files.
If you need anything else, or have questions feel free to ask (ex: can i get icon/svg of x)
